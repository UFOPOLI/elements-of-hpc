# High performance libraries

While the scientific computing programs solve or simulate a huge
number of different problems, many of them need to perform similar
subtasks of e.g. numerical mathematics such as solving systems of
linear equations and eigenvalue problems or performing various matrix
operations, fast Fourier transforms and so on. To make the software
developer's task easier the most common algorithms and operations are
available in performance optimized subroutine libraries that can be
*linked* to the main program.
