## What does it take to offer supercomputing service?

Offering supercomputing resources for users requires much more than procuring a system and connecting it to electricity, cooling and internet. Of course the following is not at all exhaustive but provides a simplified description of services that computing centers typically run.

**System administrators** make sure that the system runs smoothly. They monitor the usage and hardware status and load and make various adjustments accordingly. In a large machine there are always broken components that have to be replaced which may require a service break. Also system software is regularly updated to fix problems, improve and add functionality and maintain system security.

**Support for scientific software** Many computing centers, CSC included, offer a collection of scientific software and databases. The scientific software support staff procure, install and maintain the software packages based on users' needs. Additionally, they help customers in using the packages, write user guides and instructions and provide related training. In some cases there is also in-house scientific software development. As an example CSC develops the finite element method based multiphysics modeling software called Elmer, which has a global user base.

**HPC programming support** helps users in porting, parallelizing and optimizing their codes for the supercomputers. Extracting good performance from modern accelerated systems is not always easy, and it cannot be expected that the scientists of various fields are experts in high performance computing too, especially when computational methods are utilized in new fields of science not having the tradition in HPC use. And as above, the HPC programming support staff contributed to user guides and training.
