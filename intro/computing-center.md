## What does it take to offer supercomputing service?

Offering supercomputing resources for users requires more than procuring a system and connecting it to electricity, cooling and internet.

**System administrators** make sure that the system runs smoothly. They monitor the usage and hardware status and load and make various adjustments accordingly. In a large machine there are always broken components that have to be replaced which may require a service break. Also system software is regularly updated to fix problems, improve and add functionality and maintain system security.

**Support for scientific software** Many computing centers, CSC included, offer a collection of scientific software and databases.

**HPC programming support**
