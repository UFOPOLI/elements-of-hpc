## What does it take to provide supercomputing service?

Providing supercomputing resources for users requires much more than procuring a system and adding power, cooling and internet. Of course, the following list is not at all exhaustive but provides a simplified description of the services that computing centers typically run.

**System administrators** make sure that the system runs smoothly. They monitor the usage, hardware status and load and make various adjustments accordingly. In a large machine, there are always broken components that have to be replaced, which may require a service break. System software is also regularly updated to fix problems, improve and add functionality, and maintain system security.

**Support for scientific software** Many computing centers, CSC included, offer a collection of scientific software and databases. The scientific software support staff procure, install and maintain the software packages based on the users' needs. Additionally, they help the customers in using the packages, write user guides and instructions, and provide related training. In some cases, there is also in-house scientific software development. As an example, CSC develops the finite element method based multiphysics modeling software called Elmer which has a global user base.

**HPC programming support** helps users in porting, parallelizing and optimizing their codes for the supercomputers. Extracting good performance from modern accelerated systems is not always easy, and the scientists of various fields cannot be expected to be experts in high-performance computing, especially when computational methods are utilized in new fields of science with no tradition of HPC use.
