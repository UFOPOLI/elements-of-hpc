### The three paradigms of science

In scientific research various methods are used for finding explanations of natural phenomena and making predictions about their behavior. The traditional methods are experimental and theoretical. Experimental science is based on observations and measurements and theoretical science develops models (that are sometimes called laws of nature) which fit (or "explain") measurements and in the best case predict phenomena that have not yet been observed.

Early astronomy is an example of experimental science. Ancient astronomers watched the skies first with bare eyes and then with telescopes and recorded the positions and 
movements of the sun, the moon, stars, the planets of our solar system and so on. They noted that their observations followed certain patterns. Similarly, one can for 
example drop stones of various weights from towers of different heights and measure the time it takes the stones to hit the ground.

Based on these observations one may then be able to predict the time of sunset for a given day and say that the flight time of a rock is roughly the same regardless of the weight if dropped from the same height and so on. Next a theoretical scientist takes a look at the results and wonders how he or she explain them. For our examples mathematical models for gravity and dynamics developed by Newton were able to produce predictions that fit the measured results very nicely.

This is an example of the interplay between the experimental and theoretical approach, which are considered the two traditional paradigms of science. Usually observations come first and then theory developed to explain them. But not always; for example the existence of the positron (the antiparticle of electron) was first predicted by Paul Dirac in 1931 from a purely theoretical point of view. Subsequently Carl Anderson confirmed the existence of the positron experimentally in 1932 (and received a Nobel prize in 1936 for his discovery).

However, there are limits to what can be done with paper and pen or what kind of experiments can be set up. For example, continuing with the astronomical theme, it is 
easy enough to write down the equations that descibe the motion of the Sun, Moon and Earth (this a so called three body problem), but these equations cannot be solved in closed form. That is, there is no formula where one can plug in the time to get the positions of the heavenly bodies involved. However, an approximate solution can be found numerically.

On the other hand, consider climate and glaciers, for example. It is of crucial importance to know what is going to happen with them in the future. But naturally we cannot perform experiments in global scale to find that out. Similarly, in many cases the required experiments would be too expensive, too dangerous, too slow, too difficult or complex, unethical and so on. But we may still have an idea of the underlaying theory.

This brings us to computational science that is sometimes called the third paradigm of scientific research. Computational science
