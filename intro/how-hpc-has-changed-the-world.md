### The paradigms of science

In scientific research various methods are used for finding explanations of natural phenomena and making predictions about their behavior. The traditional methods are experimental and theoretical. Experimental science is based on observations and measurements and theoretical science develops models (that are sometimes called laws of nature) which fit (or "explain") measurements and in the best case predict phenomena that have not yet been observed.

Early astronomy is an example of experimental science. Ancient astronomers watched the skies first with bare eyes and then with telescopes and recorded the positions and 
movements of the sun, the moon, stars, the planets of our solar system and so on. They noted that their observations followed certain patterns. Similarly, one can for 
example drop stones of various weights from towers of different heights and measure the time it takes the stones to hit the ground.

Based on these observations one may then be able to predict the time of sunset for a given day and say that the flight time of a rock is roughly the same regardless of the weight if dropped from the same height and so on. Next a theoretical scientist takes a look at the results and wonders how he or she explain them. For our examples mathematical models for gravity and dynamics developed by Newton were able to produce predictions that fit the measured results very nicely.
