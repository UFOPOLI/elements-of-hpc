# What are supercomputers used for?

In experimental research, different scientific instruments are needed
for different problems: particle accelerator in CERN cannot be used
for studying cosmic waves, and a vast radiotelescope cannot be used
for studying subatomic particles.

Supercomputer is a unique scientific tool in the sense that the same
apparatus can be used for studying extremely short length and time scales (as
in elemental particles) as well as extremely long length and time
scales (as motion of galaxies in the universe).

Below we show few representative examples where supercomputers are
indispensable, more cases will be discussed in the end of the course.

## Collisions of nanoparticles

The video shows simulation about gold nanoparticles colliding into gold
surface. Size of the particle is about 20 nm, *i.e.* 20 millionth part
of millimeter. Understanding these type of processes is important for
example, for radiation damage in spacecraft.

## Spreading of aerosols in the air

When people breathe, they emit aerosols into the air. The spreading of
these aerosols can be studied with supercomputers which helps us
fighting the COVID pandemic.

## Climate change

In order to understand effects of carbon emissions to the climate,
simulations over long time scales are needed. The video below shows
a millenium scale simulations concerning surface air temperature in
the Arctic and Greenland glacier ice thickness, e.g. when will the
Arctic see ice be gone during summer and during winter according to
the simulations.
