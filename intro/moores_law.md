# Moore's Law

* Every 2 years the density of the transitors double 2 years

## Consquences

* smaller transitors require less voltage and current
* smaller voltage implies higher clock rates
* higher clocker rate resulted in sinlge processor performance doubling every 18 months

## End of the law?
* clock has been capped which resulted putting more cores, while still doubling the density of the transitors
* single precision saturated, total performance still doubling
* reaching the physical limit of miniaturization
