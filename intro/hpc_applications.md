# What are supercomputers used for ?
HPC has been a critical part of academic research and innovation for a long time. "In-silica" experiments can reduce and in some cases  eliminate the need for physical tests. In the same time results are obtained much faster.  This reduces costs and drives innovation. Below are some examples in which HPC plays an important role.


### Materials Science
* new materials
* design of meta-materials
* industrial processes

### Engineering & Industry
* oil and gas: finding new reservoirs, fluid flow and seismic processing
* aerospace: flow of air over the wings
* financial technology: risk analysises, high-frquency trading, financial modeling, fraud detection
* cybersecurity
* constuction
