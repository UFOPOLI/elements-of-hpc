# What are supercomputers used for ?
HPC has been a critical part of academic research and innovation for a long time. "In-silica" experiments can reduce in some cases t eliminate the need for physical tests. 
## Materials Science
* new materials
* design of meta-materials
* industrial processes

## Industry
* oil and gas: finding new reservoirs, fluid flow and seismic processing
* aerospace: flow of air over the wings
* financial technology: risk analysises, high-frquency trading, financial modeling, fraud detection
* cybersecurity
