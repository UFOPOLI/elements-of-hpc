# Types of parallelism
* Bit-level parallelism: refers the parallelism based on increasing the _processor word_ size. For example in the case of a 8-bit processor trying to add 2 16-bit variables it would have to divide the operation in two instructions. In the first instruction it would add the 8 lower bits and then in the second one the higher 8 bits. On a 16-bit processor this would be completed using a single instruction. Now all processors use the words of 64 bits. The programmers have no control at this level, but have to take into account and choose the appropriate bit size in order to achieve the higher performance possible at the precision required by the specific application. 
* Instruction-level parallelism: refers to executing simualtenous multiple instructions. For example if the program has to perform sequently two additions which can are independent from each other they can be executed in parallel (see image below). The programmer does not have direct access to the this parallelization, the compiler does the parallelizatiom, however the programer needs to arrgange the code to "help" the compiler detect the paralllizable parts.

* Vectorization: refers to a parallelism similar to the ILP, in which a specific instruction is apply to multiple data. This allows for a more efficient parallelization of the code than the ILP. Similar to the ILP the programmer has little control over the parallism, however can indicate specific loops qhich can be targeted by the compiler.
* Core level parallelism: the same calculation or different calculation is performed to the same data set or to different sets. The calculations are performed concurrently and often cooperatively. This case can include many parallel modes, multi-threaded with shared memory, multi-processing with distributed memory and as well task paralallelism in which each diffferent task runs indipendently of the others.
