# Memory Hierarchy
The memory in the personal computers can be divided in **external memory** comprising of peripheral storage devices (magnetic disks, optical disks, magnetic tapes, etc.) accessible by the processor via input/output modules and the **internal memory** (RAM memory, L1, L2 and L3 processor cache, and registers) where the programs reside during execution, which can be directly accessed by the processors. The external memory is used for the long time storage. The magnetic disks can be used by the OS as virtual RAM in the case when the computer runs out of memory. While Linux also uses something equivalent we note that in HPC using virtual memory would slow down the execution significantly and it is reseved only for the OS related programs.

# Memory Hierarchy Design
The memory model in the image is constructed based on the following characteristics: 
* Performance: as we move from the bottom of the pyramid to the top the transfer speed MB/s increases.
* Access Time: the time between read/write requests decreases as we move up in the hierarchy.
* Capacity: the global amount of information that the device can store increase when going to the bottom.
* Cost per bit: the higher in the hierarchy the more costly the memory is. The internal memory is more expensive than the external memory.

# Types of memory:
*  **CPU/GPU Registers**: are the fastest type of memory in a system/device. They are used to access very fast the data which is used for the calculation running at a given type. Physically the registers are part of the processors and some of them are part of specific set of instructions.
*  **L1, L2, L3 processor cache**:  are another type of memory which are part of the processing units, which are used to store copies of the data frequently used.  There exist a hierarchy of cache types. In CPU L1 cache denotes the cache which is available only to the processing core itself. L2 cache is a cache which is accesable by cores which are grouped together in a NUMA unit, while L3 cache is usually accesible by all cores in a die. In GPUs each processing core has a L1 cach and each multiprocessing unit has a L2 cache accessible by all cores in that unit. In addition there is also the so-called shared memory present which can be explicitly used by the programmer. 
*  **Random Access Memory (RAM)**: is the the main memory in a computer where all the instructions  and all the data of the active programs reside. It si realteveily and it has the advantage is that the individual memory cells can be accessed in any order. 

All the above type of memory are used for running the programs and they are volatile. At the end of the program or in case of shutting down of the computer the contents are purged and not retrievable at later times.  Peripheral storage devices are used for storing the data for later access after the end of the program execution. 


* **Magnetic disks** The magnetic disks are storage devices that use magnetization to access represent and access the data. Magnetic disks are relatively cheap and they consist of rotating disks and a mechanical arm which moves over it to read and write. Conceptually, the surface of the disk is divided in many small magnetic regions, each of them with an uniform magnetizations. While the disk rotates at very high speeds, the tip of the mechanical arm gets magnetized and affects the individual domains changing the local magnetization, or can in the case of reading it can detect the local magnetization. 
* **Optical disks** are storage devices for storing large amounts of data for long term. It is a flat disc which stores binary data in form of pits and lands. `1` representing a change from pit to land and viceversa, while `0` no change regardless of whether in a land or a pit area. Having rewritable it is quite common  now, however since most of the usage is for content distribution it is quite common that the disks are written one time, after which they are read-only. 
* **Magnetic tape** is a system for storing data nowdays mostly used  for back-up large amounts of data. The main reason for using it is the extremly low price per MB. Many present-day supercomputers use magnetic tapes to save user data in case of disk failure. The bandwidth of magentic tapes is quite high, however the access is sequential and retrieving specific piees of data can be very slow.
