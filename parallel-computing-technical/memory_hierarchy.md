# Memory Hierarchy
The memory in the personal computers can be divided in **external memory** comprising of periferal storage devices (magnetic disks, optical disks, magnetic tapes, etc.) accessible by the processor via input/output modules and the **internal memory** where the programs reside during execution, which can be directly access by the processors.
