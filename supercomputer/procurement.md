# Acquisition of a Supercomputer

Most of the users have access to a supercomputer but they are not familiar with the procedure to acquire one. It is a procedure that takes months. It is a team effort of many people from various fields.

a supercomputer based on its needs, as the users are different, thus a vendor should provide different hardware solutions.
