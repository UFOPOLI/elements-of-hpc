# Acquisition of a Supercomputer

Most of the users have access to a supercomputer but they are not familiar with the procedure to acquire one. It is a procedure that takes months. It is a team effort of many people from various fields. 
We need to have a budget, understand what the users need, what applications are executed more often, the strategic vision, benchmark new technologies, and discuss with the vendors. Every organization needs 
a supercomputer based on its needs, as the users are different, thus a vendor should provide different hardware solutions. For example an organization maybe needs only CPUs, while another ones CPUs with GPUs,
maybe the applications performance depends on the speed of the interconnection, thus someone would need to invest more money on the interconnection between the nodes. Or someone also needs more powerful
processor. Thus, every solution is uniq according to that the customers want.

Moreover, a request for proposal (RFP) is prepared with all the significant details and requirements. Meantime, an organization can ask for more information through the request for information (RFI). 
Then the qualified vendors are invited to bid for the specific proposal. The vendors present their solution among also, some performance results of the proposed applications. It is obvious that the 
procurement of a supercomputer takes long time and many people need to collaborate to achieve the final result.
