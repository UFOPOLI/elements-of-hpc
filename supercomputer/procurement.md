# Acquisition of a Supercomputer

Most of the users have access to a supercomputer but they are not familiar with the procedure to acquire one. It is a procedure that takes months. It is a team effort of many people from various fields. 
We need to have a budget, understand what the users need, what applications execute more often, the strategic vision, benchmark new technologies, and discuss with the vendors. Every organization needs 
a supercomputer based on its needs, as the users are different, thus a vendor should provide different hardware solutions.

Moreover, a request for proposal (RFP) is prepared with all the significant details and requirements. Meantime, an organization can ask for more information through the request for information (RFI). Then the qualified vendors are invited to bid for the specific proposal.  The vendors present their solution among also, usually, some results of the proposed applications.
