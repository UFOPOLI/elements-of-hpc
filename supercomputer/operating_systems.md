Personal computers are **single user** devices for general purposes. While the perfomance of a modern personal computer can surpass the old supercomputers, they are not aiming for the maximum perfomance. The operating system is rather orientated more towards software compatibility,  usability, entertaining, office work,  mobility, etc.. At this moment more than $77 \%$ of personal computers use Windows, while around  $17 \%$ are running maSOs (Apple proprietary operating systems). The rest of the devices use ChromeOs or some version of Linux or Unix. 
Supercomputers are focused on performing intensive number crunching, mainly for scientific purpose. While usually  it is expected to serve thousandss of users simualtaneously, the operating system is designed to facilitate the  best performance of the processing.  In addition to this the operarting system has to  manage very complicated job scheduling and the disk management. 

For  couples of years  all supercomputers which are making it to Top 500 use Linux. Linux is free and open-source, so every programmer can develop it and make amendments when a problme is found. Unlike Windows and macOS, Linux is modular and build around a kernel which contains the basic system and drivers. The users now can add to the kernel various modules to serve purpose of the device. From its creation Linux was focused on system security, process management and stability.
