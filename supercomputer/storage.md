## Storage

* One important part of a Supercomputer is the infrastructure that we save our data. This infrastructure is called storage.

* With simple words you can think that a storage is a an area with many hard disks. For example, Mahti has a storage of 8.7 Petabytes (PB) or 8908.8 Terabytes (TB) of hard disks, totally around to 890 hard disks of 10 TB each. This means that the available space is almost 8908 Macbook Pro 13" with 1 TB available space each. However, the Macbook includes a faster storage than our single hard disk. A supercomputer can not always have a really big fast storage as it is significantly more expensive than the classic hard disks that we can just buy more space and cheaper

* Users of the supercomputers need enough storage to save their data, execute their simulations, save output files, analyze data, thus, we need to have enough space to accomodate their requests.

* The design of a storage can be a complicated procedure and it is out of the scope of this course. With simple words a parallel file system is designed in order to be able to support large parallel operations that read and write a file among also many users utilizing the filesystem in the same time. A parallel file system is a software designed to store data across multiple networked servers to accomodate high-performance access. There are many different parallel file systems where we just mention few of them and their links if you would like to read, such as [Lustre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lustre_(file_system)), [GPFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPFS), [BeeGFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeeGFS)
