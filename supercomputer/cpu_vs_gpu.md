# CPU vs. GPU

When comparing the CPU to GPU one word can describe the differences, **complexity**. Below there is a schematic representation CPU and GPU side by side.

CPU are in general more complex, "smarter# devices orientated toward general purpose usage. It has a large part of the transitors dedicated to branch prediction and another large part to cache for prefetching data from the memory. Compared to the GPUs the amount of transitors dedicated to the mathematical operations is small. Compared to the CPU the GPU has a very small amputn of transitors dedicated to
