## A brief history of supercomputing

The history of machine computing started with mechanical computers which used gears, levers, curved plates etc. to perform calculations. The mechanical computers were typically single-purpose machines and could not be programmed in the modern sense. In addition to the standard desk calculators, typical examples were the devices used in aiming bombs, guns and torpedoes during World War II. However, programmable motor-driven mechanical machines such as Z1 were also developed.

The mechanical computers were succeeded by electro-mechanical machines which used switches and relays to implement logic.

ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), which became operational in 1945, was the first fully electronic programmable general-purpose computer and can
be considered the first supercomputer. Originally constructed for calculating artillery shell and missile trajectories, it was located at the University of Pennsylvania and contributed to the US thermonuclear weapons development.

ENIAC relied on vacuum tubes, and its performance (about 400 flops or floating point operations per second) was in the order of one thousand times greater than the preceding electro-mechanical computers. ENIAC was a decimal (as opposed to modern binary) computer and was programmed by changing the configuration of the system by turning dials and plugging cables to receptables.

ENIAC and its vacuum-tubed successors were followed by transistorized systems in the latter half of the 1950's. IBM's 7090 mainframe (first installation in 1959) was specifically designed for solving large-scale scientific and engineering problems.

The term *supercomputing* was first used in 1964 when Control Data Corporation introduced the CDC 6600 system designed by Seymour Cray, whose name went on to became synonymous with supercomputers. An improved version, called CDC 6700, was introduced in 1969. Cray subsequently left Control Data Corporation, founded a company of his own, and in 1976 debuted the iconic Cray-1 supercomputer.

In addition to Cray (now a product line of HPE), the most common names of the supercomputer vendors include IBM, SGI/Silicon Graphics, Hewlett-Packard, Atos, Dell, Intel, Fujitsu, Lenovo and Sun.

Nowadays, a supercomputer is often defined as a computer that has much larger
computing power than a typical desktop computer. As computers constantly become more powerful, this is a moving defintion. As an example, a
modern laptop is 1000 times more powerful than the biggest
supercomputer in the Nordic countries thirty years ago. ![Cray X-MP Supercomputer](images/Cray-X-MP.jpg)

## Supercomputing in Finland and at CSC

CSC's (Center for Scientific Computing) history can be traced back to 1971 when a special office was founded to operate a Univac 1108 system. There have since been a number of changes to the name, the organization and the owner of the entity that was tasked with operating the Finnish high-performance computing resources for scientists. In the 1990's, the name CSC was introduced, and the Ministry of Education and Culture became the sole owner of the company. Today, universities and polytechnics own a minor share of CSC – IT Center for Science Ltd.

CSC and its predecessors have operated the following major systems in Finland:
