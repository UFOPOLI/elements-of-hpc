# Cloud computing vs. "traditional" HPC


**High performance computing** (HPC)  most generally refers to the use of parallel processing for running advanced application programs efficiently, reliably and quickly, in a way that delivers much higher performance than one could get out of a typical personal computer. Nowdays HPC  can involve thousands or more processors working in parallel to analyse billions of pieces of data in real time, performing calculations thousands of times faster than a normal computer. Traditionally the resources for HPC comprise of bare-metal supercomputers and clusters which  are specifically designed to support HPC applications developed to solve the specific problems. All applications and libraries need to be compiled for the operating system that is installed on the machine.  The computational work (jobs) is  queued and executed when there were sufficient resources on the machine.  The applications run with direct physical access to hardware. As a result, the traditional HPC platforms are extremely fine-tuned to receive best performance of parallel processing. This approach is prefered for massive parallel processing which usually requires also a very good interconnection between the processors and a very fast disk system for data input and output operations. Supercomputers are designed to get the most of the computing resources for intensive problems, however they lacks some flexibility. The users are limited to the available software stack and have to wait for the specific resources to be freed. Also they a fixed available storage capacity. 


**Cloud computing** refers in general to the on-demand availability of computer system resources, without direct active management by the user. By Cloud Computing is usually referring to access to a pool of configurable computing resources: .  In the clouds the computing capacity  is offered using virtualization technology. On each node a hypervisor runs multiple virtual machines (VMs, or "instances") on virtual operating platforms. On these VMs one
can install Linux or Windows, and a complete custom stack of software.

Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, without direct active management by the user. Cloud Computing is a shared pool of configurable resources offering services with five essential characteristics; on-demand self-services, broad network
access, resource pooling, measured service, and rapid elasticity. A sixth characteristic that is
often not considered essential but rather as a side-effect of resource pooling regards multitenancy. 

There are five essential characteristics that shape Cloud Computing:
1. On-demand self-service: Services of the cloud are ready for the user whenever the user
demands, without having to have human interference.
2. Broad network access: Users of the cloud services are able to have access to the
services over a broad network and by using their workstations, mobile or tablets, laptops, etc)
3. Resource Pooling: Cloud services are pooled to serve several users in a multi-tenant
environment. Resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned and there is only a high level
of abstraction for the location of the resources.
4. Rapid Elasticity: Resources on the cloud appears to be unlimited for the user.
According to the user demand or even automatically the resources can scale up or down.

5. Measured Service: There is a metering system in the cloud that monitors, controls and
reports service usages for both users and providers. 

The goal of cloud computing is to allow users to take benefit from computing technologies. 
Cloud computing reduces complexity for the user.
Cloud computing saves money
Cloud delivers good performance
Storing data in the cloud is more convenient


 One limitation is that it offers  limited customization options. There are also concerns about privacy and confidentiality, some work involves NDA. While the computing can be very cheap, other fees might be leverage on data storage and manipulation.
